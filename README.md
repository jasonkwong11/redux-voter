This app collects votes from different parties in a series of rounds. Each round has a pair of options for people to vote on. After voting is complete on every round, the winner will be decided.

There will be a React browser app that provides a UI for voting. A Node server app will handle the business logic. Redux will be used to organize the application code between the client and server in Immutable data structures.
